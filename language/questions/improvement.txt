More sophisticated question answering systems might employ
other strategies (analyzing the type of question word used,
looking for synonyms of query words, lemmatizing to handle
different forms of the same word, etc.) but we’ll leave those sorts of improvements
as exercises for you to work on if you’d like to after you’ve completed this project!
